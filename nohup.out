A finite-state automaton is a dynamic, discrete, invariant system          in which the sets of input, output and state are finite.          The system can be in any of a finite number of internal states that define the automaton.          A particularly important class of automata is that of automata capable of recognizing          whether or not a string is part of a given language or not: recognizer automata.          Such a finite-state automaton consists of a finite set of states and a finite set of          transitions from one state to another. For each distinct pair formed by a state of the          automaton (the departure state) and an alphabet symbol, there is a transition to an          arrival state. The symbol of the pair is said to be associated with the transition, or          even that the transition "accepts the symbol." The state of arrival state can also          coincide with the start state. Each finite-state automaton is uniquely associated with an          oriented graph called a transition diagram. The nodes of the graph coincide with the          states of the automaton. If there is a transition from state q to state p with a as the          associated symbol, then there is an arc oriented from node q to node p and labeled with          the symbol a. See the Homepage for more. | an automaton | what is an automaton
A transition is a function which defines the movement of an          automaton from one state to another by treating the current state and current input symbol          as an ordered pair. For each pair of "current state" and "current input symbol" (the          function input), the transition function produces as output the next state in the          automaton. | a transition | what is a transition

A finite-state automaton is a dynamic, discrete, invariant system
          in which the sets of input, output and state are finite.
          The system can be in any of a finite number of internal states that define the automaton.
          A particularly important class of automata is that of automata capable of recognizing
          whether or not a string is part of a given language or not: recognizer automata.
          Such a finite-state automaton consists of a finite set of states and a finite set of
          transitions from one state to another. For each distinct pair formed by a state of the
          automaton (the departure state) and an alphabet symbol, there is a transition to an
          arrival state. The symbol of the pair is said to be associated with the transition, or
          even that the transition "accepts the symbol." The state of arrival state can also
          coincide with the start state. Each finite-state automaton is uniquely associated with an
          oriented graph called a transition diagram. The nodes of the graph coincide with the
          states of the automaton. If there is a transition from state q to state p with a as the
          associated symbol, then there is an arc oriented from node q to node p and labeled with
          the symbol a. See the Homepage for more. | an automaton | what is an automaton

A finite-state automaton is a dynamic, discrete, invariant system          in which the sets of input, output and state are finite.          The system can be in any of a finite number of internal states that define the automaton.          A particularly important class of automata is that of automata capable of recognizing          whether or not a string is part of a given language or not: recognizer automata.          Such a finite-state automaton consists of a finite set of states and a finite set of          transitions from one state to another. For each distinct pair formed by a state of the          automaton (the departure state) and an alphabet symbol, there is a transition to an          arrival state. The symbol of the pair is said to be associated with the transition, or          even that the transition "accepts the symbol." The state of arrival state can also          coincide with the start state. Each finite-state automaton is uniquely associated with an          oriented graph called a transition diagram. The nodes of the graph coincide with the          states of the automaton. If there is a transition from state q to state p with a as the          associated symbol, then there is an arc oriented from node q to node p and labeled with          the symbol a.

It is an automaton which accepts zero or more words in a binary alphabet formed by a      sequence of a triple of 1s followed by a pair of 0s. There are a total of 5 states: q0, q1,      q2, q3, and q4. q0 is both initial and end state.      From each state 1 arc starts: from q0 the arc points to q1 and is marked with 1.      From q1 it points to q2 and is marked with 1.      From q2 it points to q3 and is marked with 1.      From q3 points to q4 and is marked with 0.      Finally, from q4 points to q0 and is marked again with 0. | the position of arcs | describe the position of arcs
I dont' know. Try asking something like, "Describe the automaton." |  is there any self loop  | is there any self loop 
I'm not sure about your question. Try asking about states or transitions. Or          you can ask me to briefly describe you the automaton, for example. | a connection | what is a connection 
I dont' know. Try asking something like, "What is the accepted language?" |  represent the automaton  | represent the automaton

Hi. I'm the chatbot NoVAGraphS. I'm programmed to answer questions to describe      graphical structures, and in particular, automata. Ask me to describe you in general Automaton      1 or a more specific question about it. |  | hi
